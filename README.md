# Django-Rasa Chatbot Project

## Project Overview
This Django-Rasa Chatbot is a sophisticated web application designed to offer a real-time interactive chat experience. It integrates Django's robust web development capabilities with Rasa's conversational AI, enhanced by WebSockets for live communication, and uses Celery with Redis for efficient background task processing and message queuing. The application is tailored for an engaging user experience with user authentication, personalized chat histories, and real-time response capabilities.

### Key Features
- **User Authentication:** Secure system for user registration and login, ensuring personalized experiences.
- **Chat History:** Maintains individual chat histories for each user, allowing for continuity in conversations.
- **Real-Time Interaction:** Leverages WebSockets for real-time messaging between users and the chatbot.
- **Conversational AI:** Powered by Rasa, capable of understanding and responding to user queries in natural language.
- **Asynchronous Task Processing:** Utilizes Celery with Redis for managing background tasks like saving chat messages in real-time.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Designed for scalability and efficient handling of multiple concurrent user interactions.
